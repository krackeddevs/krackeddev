# Assets Request for Anep

## Overview
We need additional game assets for the 2D overworld playground to enhance visual variety and polish.

## Current Implementation
We've implemented placeholder graphics using canvas rendering for:
- **Trees** - Simple pixel-art style trees with brown trunks and green leaves
- **Gravel paths** - Gray/brown rocky texture
- **Pavement paths** - Light gray concrete with grid lines
- **Grass** - Green grass tiles with texture

## Assets Needed

### Ground/Floor Tiles
1. **Grass tiles** (variations)
   - Different grass textures for variety
   - Maybe some with flowers or small details

2. **Gravel/Stone paths**
   - More detailed gravel texture
   - Edge tiles for path borders
   - Corner tiles

3. **Pavement/Concrete**
   - Clean pavement tiles
   - Edge tiles
   - Corner tiles
   - Maybe some with cracks or details for variety

4. **Other path types** (optional)
   - Dirt paths
   - Wooden planks
   - Brick paths

### Building Assets
1. **Building sprites**
   - Better building graphics for each type (Jobs, Blog, Code, Profile, Whitepaper)
   - Maybe animated elements (lights, signs)
   - Different building styles/variations

2. **Building details**
   - Doors
   - Windows
   - Signs/labels
   - Roof details

### Decorative Elements
1. **Trees** (variations)
   - Different tree types
   - Different sizes
   - Maybe seasonal variations

2. **Other decorations**
   - Rocks
   - Flowers
   - Benches
   - Street lamps
   - Fences

## Technical Requirements
- **Tile size**: 40x40 pixels
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Pixel art / retro game style (matching current aesthetic)
- **Color palette**: Should match current game colors (green grass, gray walls, etc.)

## Priority
1. **High Priority**: Better building sprites, improved ground tiles
2. **Medium Priority**: Tree variations, decorative elements
3. **Low Priority**: Additional path types, seasonal variations

## Notes
- All assets should be walkable/non-walkable consistent with current game logic
- Trees are currently non-walkable obstacles
- Ground tiles are walkable
- Buildings are non-walkable but trigger interactions when player is near
